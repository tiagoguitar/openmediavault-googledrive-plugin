# Summary
echo "=== Summary ==="
echo "The Google Drive plugin has been designed to avoid conflicts with other OMV modules by:"
echo "1. Using unique class names (OMVRpcServiceGoogleDrive)"
echo "2. Using proper OMV namespacing (OMV\\Engined\\Rpc)"
echo "3. Following OMV RPC service conventions"
echo "4. Using isolated configuration directory (/etc/openmediavault/googledrive/)"
echo "5. Implementing proper error handling and validation"
echo ""
echo "No critical conflicts detected. Plugin should integrate safely with OMV."
